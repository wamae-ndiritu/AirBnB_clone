                                <h3>From Abdullah Al the 30th September 2023</h3>
                                <p>I recently stayed at "The Nest" on Champagne Ridge for five nights, and it was truly fantastic.
                                The views of the Rift Valley from the cottage were absolutely breathtaking. The cottage itself was designed to make the
                                most of these views with large glass doors that open fully. The bed was super comfy, and the shower was a fun surprise.
                                Debs the host, was incredibly helpful. Everything was provided for a great stay, and while there's no Wi-Fi, cell
                                reception was good enough. Plus, there's a BBQ grill for cooking.
                                The Nest is only couple of hours drive from Nairobi and offers a peaceful escape. If you're looking for a secure,
                                off-grid retreat with incredible views and friendly host, this is the place to be. I can't wait to go back.</p>
